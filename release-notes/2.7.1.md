## Summary

This is a maintenance release of Canton, addressing a few issues.

## Whatâ€™s New

## Deprecations

- `SequencerConnection.addConnection` is deprecated. Use `SequencerConnection.addEndpoints` instead.

## Packaging

We have reverted the change from 2.7.0 that introduced the distribution of a separate `bcprov-jdk15on-1.70.jar` along the canton jar in the `lib` folder.
If you use the Oracle JRE, beware that you will now need to explicitly add the [bouncycastle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html) library to the classpath when running canton.


## Security and Bugfixes

### Fixed `rotate_node_keys` command when it is used to rotate keys of sequencer(s) and mediator(s)

#### Background
Canton has a series of console commands to rotate keys, in particular, `rotate_node_keys` that is used
to rotate de keys of a node.

#### Description
When we use the console macro `rotate_node_keys` to rotate the keys of a sequencer or mediator the keys are
actually not rotated because we are: (1) looking at the wrong topology management store and (2) not using the
associated domainManager to actually rotate the keys.

#### Effected protocol versions
Canton v2.6 and later.

#### Impact
The rotation of the keys for a sequencer or mediator will not succeed.

#### Workaround
Select the correct topology management `Active` store (the one from the domainManager) to look for keys to rotate and
call the `rotate_key` console command with the domainManager reference.

#### Likeliness
Everytime we use `rotate_node_keys` to rotate the keys of sequencer(s) or mediator(s).

#### Recommendation
Upgrade the Canton console that you use to administrate the domain, in particular the sequencer and mediator,
to a Canton version with the bug fix.
