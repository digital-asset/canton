## Summary

This is a maintenance release of Canton, addressing a few issues.

## Whatâ€™s New

### Bugfixes
- We fixed a bug where the participant could not properly restart after a crash under high load. The issue can be detected through log messages of the type `WARN  c.d.c.p.DynamicDomainParametersLookup:participant=XXX/domain=YYY - Querying for list of domain parameters changes valid at T has not completed after N seconds`. If encountered, it can be fixed by upgrading to a Daml version containing this patch and restarting the node.
- We improved the throttling of the asynchronous message processing to limit the required memory resources required by a participant while catching up with a domain.  If the node has fallen behind sufficiently and is memory constrained, this can lead to OutOfMemory exceptions that will happen periodically until the node is caught up again. If encoutered, it can be fixed by upgrading to a Daml version containing this patch and restarting the node or by granting substantially more memory to the process.
