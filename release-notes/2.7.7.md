## Summary

This is a maintenance release, fixing critical issue which can occur if overly large transactions are submitted to the participant.
The bootstrap domain command has been slightly improved, but it may now throw an error if you try to bootstrap an already
initialized domain while the domain manager node is still starting up.

## Bugfixes

### (24-002, Critical): Looping DB errors for transactions with many (32k) key updates

#### Issue Description
If a transaction with a very large number of key updates is submitted to the participant, the SQL query to update the contract keys table will fail, leading to a database retry loop, stopping transaction processing. The issue is caused by a limit of 32k rows in a prepared statement in the JDBC Postgres driver.

#### Affected Deployments
Participant on Postgres

#### Affected Versions
2.3-2.6,
2.7.0-2.7.6
2.8.0-2.8.1

#### Impact
Transactions can be submitted to the participant, but the transaction stream stops emitting transactions and commands don't appear to succeed.

#### Symptom
A stuck participant, continuously logging about "Now retrying operation 'com.digitalasset.canton.participant.store.db.DbContractKeyJournal.addKeyStateUpdates'" and "Tried to send an out-of-range integer as a 2-byte value: 40225"

#### Workaround
Upgrade to a version containing the fix. Alternatively, such a transaction may be ignored, but this must be done with care to avoid a ledger fork in case of multiple involved participants. Contact support.

#### Likeliness
Deterministic with very large (32k key updates) transactions.

#### Recommendation
Upgrade at your convenience or if experiencing the error.

### (24-005, Major): Race condition during domain manager startup may prevent startup after upgrade

#### Issue Description
A race condition in the domain bootstrap macro and domain manager node initialisation may result in a domain manager overriding the previously stored domain parameters. This can cause the domain manager to be unable to reconnect to the domain after upgrading to version 2.7 or beyond without a hard domain migration to pv=5, as with 2.7, the default protocol version changed to pv=5.

#### Affected Deployments
Domain Manager Nodes

#### Affected Versions
All 2.3-2.6
2.7.0-2.7.6
2.8.0-2.8.1

#### Impact
The domain manager node is unable to connect to the sequencer. Topology transactions such as party additions have no effect on the domain, as they are not verified and forwarded by the domain manager.
#### Symptom
Parties added to the participant do not appear on the domain. Transactions referring to such parties are rejected with UNKNOWN_INFORMEE. The domain manager logs complain about "The unversioned subscribe endpoints must be used with protocol version 4"
#### Workaround
If you don't run bootstrap_domain after the domain was already initialised, the issue won't happen. If a node is affected, you can recover the node explicitly by seting the protocol version to v=4 in the configuration and use the reset-stored-static-config parameter to correct the wrongly stored parameters.
#### Likeliness
Race condition which can happen if you run the bootstrap_domain command repeatedly on an already bootstrapped domain during startup of the domain manager node. As there is no need to run the bootstrap_domain command repeatedly, this issue can easily be avoided.

#### Recommendation
Do not run the bootstrap_domain command after the domain was initialised.
A fix has been added to prevent future mistakes.
