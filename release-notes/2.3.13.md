## Summary

This is a bugfix only release of Canton with two improvements in the crash recovery of a participant node.

## Whatâ€™s New

### Bugfixes

#### Crash recovery bug in request counter allocator for repair requests

Description
: When using the repair service of a participant, the participant may fail to reconnect to the domains affected by the repairs.

Affected deployments
: All deployments

Affected versions
: All currently released enterprise versions of Canton.

Impact
: The participant cannot connect to the affected domain any more.

Symptom
: The participant log file contains an `ERROR` message of the form
`An internal error has occurred. java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot skip request counter ... other than the next request counter ...`

Workaround
: Upgrading to a Canton version with the released bug fix should resolve the problem.

Likelihood of the bug
: The bug can occur only if the repair service is used on a participant.
The repair service is internally used by the party migration console macros, for example.

Recommendation
: Upgrade the participant to a Canton version with the bug fix and restart the node.

#### Crash recovery bug in ACS commitment processing

Description
: A participant may fail to reconnect to a domain and the reconnect attempt seems stuck.

Affected deployments
: All deployments

Affected versions
:  All currently released enterprise versions of Canton.

Impact
: The participant cannot connect to a domain any more.

Symptom
: No error is logged in the participants log file, but the reconnect command will appear to be stuck.

Workaround
: Upgrading to a Canton version with the released bug fix should resolve the problem.

Likelihood of the bug
: The bug occurs only for a particular order of events that are processed during the reconnect of a participant to a domain.
Not all participant nodes may be affected for the same domain.

Recommendation
: Upgrade the participant to a Canton version with the bug fix and restart the node.
