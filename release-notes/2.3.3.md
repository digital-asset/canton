## Summary

This is a patch release with minor improvements and bug fixes.

## Whatâ€™s New

### Minor Improvements
- Some queries that start to be expensive in high latency environments have been optimised to reduce the resource usage, leading to minor throughput gains.
- We have fixed an issue, where requests were throttled prematurely in case of high levels of heap usage.
