## Summary

This release contains minor improvements, namely reducing the database load on highly available
sequencers, as well as an availability bug fix that could prevent a passive participant node to successfully become active.

## Whatâ€™s New

### Security and Bugfixes
- Fixed an issue where the polling logic of the sequencer reader in an HA setting did not honor the configured polling interval.
- Fixed an issue in HA participants under high load that may cause a passive replica to not serve transactions when becoming active again.
