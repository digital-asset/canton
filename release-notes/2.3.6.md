## Summary
This release fixes a set of issues. Customers on the 2.3 release line are advised to upgrade to this version.
Please note that release 2.3.5 has been skipped.

## Whatâ€™s New

### Minor Improvements
- New repair commands `repair.identity.download` and `repair.identity.upload` for downloading and uploading the identity and keys of a node. They can be used to preserve a node's identity and keys when its storage is reset.
- Improved resilience of ethereum sequencer to network failures & overloaded Ethereum clients returning invalid data.

### Security and Bugfixes
- Fixed a memory leak in the mediator that would lead to JVM degradation over time.
- Fixed an error that could lead to rare crashes when restarting an Ethereum sequencer node and zombie queries on associated Besu nodes.
- Fixed an issue where multiple mediator response messages would confuse transaction processing.
