- moved part of documentation to docs-open
- removed instances of Sirius
- Interactive Console help now available through `help` commands
- Console commands now return values where appropriate
- Console will now choose depending on where it's being run how to handle errors and console output:
  - Interactive/REPL will print output to stdout+stderr and errors will not be fatal
  - Headless scripts will log output to our slf4j loggers and errors will kill the process with a non-zero exit code
  - Mode for running scripts in a ScalaTest environment that will log output to slf4j loggers and non-fatal errors
