## Summary

This is a maintenance release, addressing a few issues elaborated below.

### Security and Bugfixes

- We have implemented a validation for resilience against malicious participant nodes.
  Currently, some planned validations have not yet been implemented, as stated in
  https://docs.daml.com/canton/architecture/requirements/requirements.html#security,
  but there was one issue that we prefer to be fixed now.

- We've removed the warning message when using Postgres 10. Canton does functionally support Postgres 10,
  but all our performance tuning is done against Postgres 11.

- Fixed a bug in the participant that rarely causes the participant to refuse to reconnect to a domain and wrongly report that a ledger fork has happened: `ForkHappened`
