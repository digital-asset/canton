## Summary

This is a maintenance release containing a performance improvement.

## Whatâ€™s New

### Optimization of message construction between participants and domains

In version 2.5.0, the size of messages exchanged between participants and
domains was decreased. While significantly reducing bandwidth consumption, this
change increased the number of nodes in the tree, increasing in turn the time
to perform blinding. In this release, the blinding algorithm is optimized to
perform in O(N * log N) instead of O(N * N), so that the execution time of
large batches of transactions remains close to linear.
