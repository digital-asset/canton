## Summary

The version 2.3.2 brings a few minor improvements and bugfixes for Fabric/Besu sequencers.

### Sequencer Health Checks and Fail-over

- Added a gRPC health check endpoint to sequencer nodes
- Added periodic health checks in the sequencer nodes of their dependencies (e.g. Fabric and Besu)
- Improved the fail-over behavior in the sequencer client when connected to multiple sequencers in the case that a sequencer's dependency becomes unhealthy
