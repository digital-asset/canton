## Summary

This is a maintenance release of Canton that fixes one high risk bug, which can
crash a participant node due to out of memory, and two low risk bugs.

## Bugfixes

#### (24-017, High): Participants crash with an OutOfMemoryError

##### Description

The TaskScheduler keeps a huge number of tasks into a queue. The queue has been newly introduced. Therefore the memory comsumption (HEAP) is much higher than in previous versions. The queue size is proportional to the number of requests processed during the decision time.

##### Affected Deployments

Participant

##### Impact

Memory consumption is much higher than in previous Canton versions.

##### Symptom

The participant crashes with an OutOfMemoryError.

##### Workaround

Test the participant under load, increase the heap size accordingly. If possible, decrease confirmation response timeout and mediator reaction timeout.

##### Likeliness

High likelihood under high load and with large confirmation response and mediator reaction timeouts.

##### Recommendation

Upgrade to 2.9.3.


#### (24-018, Low): Participants log "ERROR: The check for missing ticks has failed unexpectedly"

##### Description

The TaskScheduler monitoring crashes and logs an Error.

##### Affected Deployments

Participant

##### Impact

The monitoring of the task scheduler crashes.

##### Symptom

You see an error in the logs: `ERROR: The check for missing ticks has failed unexpectedly.`.

##### Workaround

If you need the monitoring to trouble-shoot missing ticks, restart the participant to restart the monitoring.

##### Likeliness

This will eventually occur on every system.

##### Recommendation

Ignore the message until upgrading to 2.9.3.


#### (24-015, Low): Pointwise flat transaction Ledger API queries can unexpectedly return `TRANSACTION_NOT_FOUND`

##### Description
When a party submits a command that has no events for contracts whose stakeholders are amongst the submitters, the resulted transaction cannot be queried by pointwise flat transaction Ledger API queries. This impacts GetTransactionById, GetTransactionByEventId and SubmitAndWaitForTransaction gRPC endpoints.

##### Affected Deployments
Participant

##### Impact
User might perceive that a command was not successful even if it was.

##### Symptom
`TRANSACTION_NOT_FOUND` is returned on a query that is expected to succeed.

##### Workaround
Query instead the transaction tree by transaction-id to get the transaction details.

##### Likeliness
Lower likelihood as commands usually have events whose contracts' stakeholders are amongst the submitting parties.

##### Recommendation
Users are advised to upgrade to the next patch release during their maintenance window.
