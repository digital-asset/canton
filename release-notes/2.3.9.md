## Summary

This is a maintenance release, addressing an issue of Canton deployments using Oracle as the storage driver. 
Affected users are advised to upgrade to this version.

## Whatâ€™s New

### Bugfix to the Oracle storage backend

Contracts with large number of observers could lead to an Oracle exception (code ORA-03146) while writing the contract metadata.
We have modified the storage operation to not trigger the given limitation anymore. As there is no workaround,
we advise users of the Oracle storage backend to upgrade in order to avoid this limitation.
