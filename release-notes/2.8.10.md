## Summary

This is a maintenance release that fixes a critical bug for retroactive interfaces.

## Bugfixes

### (24-020, Critical): Participant crashes due to retroactive interface validation

#### Description
The view reinterpretation of an exercise of a retroactive interface may fail because the engine does not explicitly request the interface package. This can lead to a ledger fork as participants come to different conclusions.

#### Affected Deployments

Participant

#### Affected Versions
2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8.0-2.8.9

#### Impact

A participant crashes during transaction validation when using retroactive interfaces.

#### Symptom

Validating participant emits warning:
```

LOCAL_VERDICT_FAILED_MODEL_CONFORMANCE_CHECK(5,571d2e8a): Rejected transaction due to a failed model conformance check: DAMLeError(
  Preprocessing(
    Lookup(
      NotFound(
        Package(
```
And then emits an error:
```
An internal error has occurred.
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Mediator approved a request that we have locally rejected
```

#### Workaround

None

#### Likeliness

Very likely for all multi participant setups that uses retroactive interface instances.

#### Recommendation

Upgrade to 2.8.10
