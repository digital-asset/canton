## Summary

This is a maintenance release, fixing a performance degradation. Production systems of 2.6.0 are advised to consume the upgrade.

## Whatâ€™s New

### Activation of unsupported features
In order to activate unsupported features, you now need to explicitly enable `dev-version-support` on the domain (in
addition to the non-standard config flag). More information can be found in the
[documentation](https://docs.daml.com/2.6.1/canton/usermanual/FAQ.html#how-do-i-enable-unsupported-features).

### Security and Bugfixes
- Fixed a performance degradation in the mediator and database sequencer that leads to slow performance degradations after running a process for days.
- Fixed an issue in HA participants under high load that may cause a passive replica to not serve transactions when becoming active again.
- Fixed the database sequencer `max-event-age` metric not to report excessively old event ages.
- Fixed an issue in HA database sequencer setups with automatic scheduled pruning when a sequencer loses
  write-access to "exclusive storage". Now another sequencer takes over automatic pruning.
- Fixed a startup issue where a domain manager / mediator sequencer connection couldn't be changed without starting up cleanly.
- Fixed an issue where high available sequencer readers were creating higher database load than necessary.
