## Summary

This is a maintenance release including bug fixes: two in the repair service and one memory leak with metrics collection.

## Bugfixes

### (24-012, Major): repair.purge appears not to clean up key indices in cache

#### Issue Description
When contracts containing keys are purged using the repair service, the corresponding contract keys remain in the ledger API cache. Then, when a subsequent client command requests to lookup the contract behind the spent key, it is rejected already at the interpretation time in the originating participant

#### Affected Deployments
Participant

#### Affected Versions
All 2.3-2.7, 2.8.0-2.8.7

#### Impact
Participant is unable to reuse the affected keys in subsequent commands and requires a restart

#### Symptom
Participant log file contains the following error when new transaction tries to use the spent key: `NOT_FOUND: CONTRACT_NOT_FOUND(11,a61f3d3c): Contract could not be found with id...`

#### Workaround
Restart the participant as the problem only affects the in-memory data

#### Likeliness
Repair purge must be used followed by an attempt to use the key in a follow-up transaction

#### Recommendation
Users planning to use repair service should upgrade to 2.8.8

### (24-013, Minor): repair.migrate_domain prevents participant pruning

#### Issue Description
After a hard domain migration the source domain RequestJournalStore clean head check throws an IllegalArgumentException on behalf of the inactive domain and prevents participant pruning.

#### Affected Deployments
Participant

#### Affected Versions
All 2.3-2.7, 2.8.0-2.8.7

#### Impact
Participant is unable to prune.

#### Symptom
Participant log file contains the following errors when attempting to prune: `IllegalArgumentException: Attempted to prune at timestamp which is not earlier than _ associated with the clean head`

#### Workaround
None except manually updating the RequestJournalStore database to set an artificially large clean head counter

#### Likeliness
Likely after a hard domain migration

#### Recommendation
Users are advised to upgrade to 2.8.8

### (24-014, Major): Memory leak in the metrics associated with the grpc statistics

#### Issue Description
Canton components slowly accumulate memory that is not reclaimed in garbage collection. Typically it is at a rate of 250MB per week. This happens only if prometheus exporter is configured in the canton configuration file and a periodic metric read is performed by a prometheus agent.

#### Affected Deployments
All node types

#### Affected Versions
All 2.3-2.7, 2.8.0-2.8.7

#### Impact
Canton node can crash with an out-of-memory error (OOM).

#### Symptom
Node crashes. Memory dump shows an excessive memory consumption for io.opentelemetry.api.internal.InternalAttributeKeyImpl.

#### Workaround
Run a health dump on an affected node. This drains the collected metrics and reclaims associated memory.

#### Likeliness
Likely for anyone using prometheus agent.

#### Recommendation
Users are advised to upgrade to 2.8.8
