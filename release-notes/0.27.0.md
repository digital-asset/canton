# Release of Canton 0.27.0

Canton 0.27.0 has been released on August 11, 2021. You can download the Community edition from our [github release section](https://github.com/digital-asset/canton/releases/tag/v0.27.0). The Enterprise edition is available on [Artifactory](https://digitalasset.jfrog.io/artifactory/canton-enterprise/canton-enterprise-0.27.0.zip).
Please also consult the [full documentation of this release](https://www.canton.io/docs/0.27.0/user-manual/index.html).

## Summary

This release adds new features and important stability improvements. The biggest
new feature is the support of [Daml
Exceptions](https://docs.daml.com/concepts/ledger-model/ledger-exceptions.html)
in Canton! We improved the elastic deployment of horizontally scalable sequencer
nodes for performance and high availability. And many more stability and
internal improvements.

## Whatâ€™s New

### Daml Exceptions

Canton now supports [Daml
Exceptions](https://docs.daml.com/concepts/ledger-model/ledger-exceptions.html),
which have been added to Daml in previous versions to express the rollback of
parts of a transaction under failures.

#### Impact and Migration

Canton now only supports Daml-LF versions of 1.14 above. Please rebuild your
DARs using the Daml SDK 1.16.0 .

### Horizontally Scalable Sequencers

We have improved the deployment of [horizontally scalable
sequencers](https://www.canton.io/docs/0.27.0/user-manual/usermanual/ha.html#sequencer),
in particular when deploying sequencer nodes in a dynamic environment. New
sequencer nodes can be deployed dynamically and they will replace failed
sequencer nodes and take over their shards. This is an enterprise-only feature.

### Topology Management

We replaced a Daml-based package management workflow between participant nodes
with topology transactions, thereby reducing complexity and improving
performance. We also added commands to [authorize the usage of a
package](https://www.canton.io/docs/0.27.0/user-manual/usermanual/console.html#identity.vetted_packages.authorize).

#### Impact and Migration

The parameter `waitUntilPackagesReady` in package/Dar related commands has been
replaced by `synchronizeVetting`.

The command `packages.upload` has been removed, use either `dars.upload` or
`ledger_api.packages.upload_dar` instead.

### Minor Improvements
- If a participant crashes during pruning, the participant will log a warning after restart.
  The operator may then decide to prune again or to proceed with a partially pruned state.
- The submissions sent to the sequencer are slightly smaller as messages with the same content and
  different recipient groups are now sent only once to the sequencer.
- Hardening of our storage layer under failures and retries.
- Added configuration validation to detect mistakes (shared storage
  configuration between nodes without replication enabled, correct storage configuration for HA nodes)
