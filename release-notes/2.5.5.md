## Summary

This is a maintenance release bringing small fixes.

## Whatâ€™s New

### Bugfix to the Oracle storage backend
Contracts with large number of stakeholders could lead to an Oracle exception (codes ORA-03146 or ORA-01461) while
writing the contract metadata. We have modified the storage operation to not trigger the given limitation anymore.
As there is no workaround, we advise users of the Oracle storage backend to upgrade in order to avoid this limitation.

### Reduced docker images
The docker images have been trimmed to reduce the number of shipped dependencies.
