# Release of Canton 0.27.1

Canton 0.27.1 has been released on December 15, 2021. You can download the Community edition from our [github release section](https://github.com/digital-asset/canton/releases/tag/v0.27.1). The Enterprise edition is available on [Artifactory](https://digitalasset.jfrog.io/artifactory/canton-enterprise/canton-enterprise-0.27.1.zip).
Please also consult the [full documentation of this release](https://www.canton.io/docs/0.27.1/user-manual/index.html).

## Summary

This release updates the log4j dependencies used by the Fabric SDK to 2.16.
Only Canton Enterprise is affected by this, in particular the Fabric sequencer
application. Canton itself does not use log4j but the successor logback. As
the logback version we've been using also had a few CVEs, we've used the
opportunity to upgrade to the most recent version 1.2.8.

### Security and Bugfixes
- Forced Fabric SDK log4j dependency from 2.13.3 to 2.16
- Upgraded logback version from 1.2.3 to 1.2.8
