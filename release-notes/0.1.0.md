 - DAR Distribution Whitelisting: Allows whitelisting parties to permit automatically installing shared DARs without manual approval
 - Domain identity dispatching: fixed race conditions and adjusted logic to
   provide crash recovery.
 - Moved domain identity request rpc out of main domain service to ensure a
   more stable domain interface.
 - Removed hidden files from daml-samples packaging
 - Consolidated essential state and domain identity request calls into new
   domain service.
 - Essential state is now mutable. Previously, rolling the domain entity
   keys would prevent further participants to join. Now, participants can join
   at any time even if we rolled keys.
 - Health HTTP endpoint for infrastructure health and liveness probes.
 - Allow modifying domain connection settings after registration.
 - Fixed issues with scenario party lifter caused by Sets of Parties.
 - Bugfix: report proper error if scenario is run without any running
   participant node
 - Fixed issues with ledger-api list parties: now also remote parties are properly displayed.
 - Transitioned to using [Slick](http://slick.lightbend.com/) for database interactions
