## Summary

This is a maintenance release, addressing a couple of issues.

## Whatâ€™s New

### Security and Bugfixes
- We have fixed an issue in the Fabric sequencer that leads to availability issues when Fabric peers were partially down.
- We fixed a crash recovery after initialization issue with external sequencers that broke the sequencer nodes if they were restarted immediately after initialization.
- We fixed an error in the Ethereum driver that caused Zombie queries in Besu.
- We fixed a performance degradation of the database sequencer Oracle driver when being run in a high-availability configuration.
