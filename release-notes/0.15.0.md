- Ledger pruning has been renamed from participant.pruning.execute to participant.pruning.prune_by_time and no longer stops and restarts the ledger api server before and after.
- After participant ledger pruning, the ledger api's transaction and completion endpoints return an "OUT_OF_RANGE" status error on attempts to access offsets "earlier" than pruned offset. This includes particularly reading from "LEDGER_BEGIN".
- A pruning error no longer keeps the ledger api server stopped.
- Logging option "debug-full" now needs to be invoked with "--debug-full",
  as the previously used shortcut "-D" conflicts with JVM argument passing using "-D".
- Upgraded to DAML 1.2.0-snapshot.20200527
- Exposed the "transaction by id" Ledger API command through the console
- Added an optional "awaitAt" parameter to the console commands for Ledger API command submission. This will soon be replaced by "auto-sync" though
- Implemented proper fetchSome semantics for contract keys
- Fixed an error that prevented bootstrap scripts to be executed on Windows (digital-asset/canton#3)
- The reference demo now better introduces the use-case and the domain
  abstraction.
