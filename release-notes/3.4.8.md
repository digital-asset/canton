# Release of Canton 3.4.8

Canton 3.4.8 has been released on November 14, 2025.

## Summary

This is a maintenance release that fixes automatic synchronization of protocol feature flags.

## What’s New

### Minor Improvements
- The `generateExternalPartyTopology` endpoint on the Ledger API now returns a single `PartyToParticipant` topology transaction to onboard the party.
The transaction contains signing threshold and signing keys. This effectively deprecate the usage of `PartyToKeyMapping`.
For parties with signing keys both in `PartyToParticipant` and `PartyToKeyMapping`, the keys from `PartyToParticipant` take precedence.

## Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug preventing automatic synchronization of protocol feature flags.
Automatic synchronization can be disabled by setting `parameters.auto-sync-protocol-feature-flags = false` in the participant's configuration object.
