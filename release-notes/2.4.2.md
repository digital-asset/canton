## Summary

This release comes with a set of bug fixes. Users are advised to upgrade to it.

## Whatâ€™s New

### Security and Bugfixes
- We fixed a bug that would incorrectly set the ledger API DB schema when using the `currentSchema` property in the participant database config.
- We fixed an error that could lead to rare crashes when restarting an Ethereum sequencer node and zombie queries on associated Besu nodes.
- We fixed an error where the termination of one Ledger API connection could impact others too.
- We have fixed an issue in the Fabric sequencer that leads to availability issues when Fabric peers were partially down.
- We fixed a crash recovery after initialization issue with external sequencers that broke the sequencer nodes if they were restarted immediately after initialization.
- We fixed a clean shutdown issue that sometimes caused a sequencer to hang during shutdown.
- We fixed an issue in the database sequencer where sequencer failover would not succeed if the failover was triggered by a sequencer database outage.
- We fixed a performance degradation of the database sequencer Oracle driver when being run in a high-availability, microservice configuration.
