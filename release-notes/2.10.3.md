## Summary

This maintenance release updates internal dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
We recommend upgrading during your next scheduled maintenance window.

## What’s New

### Addressed security vulnerabilities

Notably, this maintenance release upgrades gRPC to version 1.75.0 and Netty to version 4.1.130.Final to address known
vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-55163 and CVE-2025-58057). Additionally, Flyway has been updated to 9.22.3, which includes
an upgrade to Jackson 2.15.2 to resolve a security vulnerability.

### New gRPC Client Configuration Options

We have introduced `keepAliveWithoutCalls` and `idleTimeout` settings for gRPC client keep-alive configurations.
Please refer to the https://grpc.io/docs/guides/keepalive/#keepalive-configuration-specification for a detailed breakdown
of these parameters.

Backward compatibility note: These two configurations are disabled by default to maintain existing behavior.

Usage note: If `keepAliveWithoutCalls` is enabled on the client, you must ensure that `permitKeepAliveWithoutCalls` is
also enabled on the server side. Additionally, `permitKeepAliveTime` may need adjustment to accommodate the increased
frequency of keep-alive pings from the client.

Example Configuration:

Participant config:

```hocon
canton.participants.participant.sequencer-client.keep-alive-client.keep-alive-without-calls = true
# And / Or
canton.participants.participant.sequencer-client.keep-alive-client.idle-timeout = 5 minutes
```

Domain config:

```hocon
# Must be enabled if keep-alive-without-calls is enabled on the client side
# Single domain
canton.domains.mydomain.public-api.keep-alive-server.permit-keep-alive-without-calls = true
canton.domains.mydomain.public-api.keep-alive-server.permit-keep-alive-time = 5 minutes
# Sequencer node
canton.sequencers.sequencer.public-api.keep-alive-server.permit-keep-alive-without-calls = true
canton.sequencers.sequencer.public-api.keep-alive-server.permit-keep-alive-time = 5 minutes
```
