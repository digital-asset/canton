- Added contract key metadata to input contracts of views (and changed the protocol protobuf)
- Upgraded to DAML SDK 0.13.54
- Canton console scripts are compiled with scalac 2.12 with flag -Xsource:2.13 to ensure smooth interoperation with DAML scala codegen
  You can switch back to 2.12 source with the Console command

  ```
    interp.configureCompiler(_.settings.processArgumentString("-Xsource:2.12"))
  ```
- Removed usedRelative field from ViewParticipantData (changing the protobuf definitions)
- Added a tutorial on workflows across multiple domains
