# Release of Canton 0.24.0

Canton 0.24.0 has been released on May 17, 2021. You can download the Community edition from our [github release section](https://github.com/digital-asset/canton/releases/tag/v0.24.0). The Enterprise edition is available on [Artifactory](https://digitalasset.jfrog.io/artifactory/canton-enterprise/canton-enterprise-0.24.0.zip).
Please also consult the [full documentation of this release](https://www.canton.io/docs/0.24.0/user-manual/index.html).

## Summary

This version focuses mostly on preview features. In particular, we have added initial support for participant
high-availability and Oracle storage backend support to our enterprise version. We've also made repair work with dirty
requests.

## Whatâ€™s New

### Participant High Availability

You can now configure the enterprise version to run with replicated participants. This is only a preview feature.
Please consult the manual on [how to configure it ](https://www.canton.io/docs/0.24.0/user-manual/usermanual/ha.html#participant) and [how it works](https://www.canton.io/docs/0.24.0/user-manual/architecture/ha/participant.html).

### Repair with Dirty Requests

The repair commands allow you to recover from data corruption and system malfunction by manually adjusting your contract
stores, as described [in our user manual](https://www.canton.io/docs/0.24.0/user-manual/usermanual/operational_processes.html#repairing-participants).
Until now, repair was only able to work on quiet domains without in-flight requests. We have improved this such that repair can be used even on domains with in-flight processing.

### Oracle Support

The storage driver now supports a new storage backend: Oracle databases. However, support is currently alpha only and only available in our Enterprise release.

### Minor Improvements

- Ability to configure max inbound message size on all APIs as described [in our user manual](https://www.canton.io/docs/0.24.0/user-manual/usermanual/static_conf.html#max-inbound-message-size).
- Fixed a bug that prevented writing log messages to the log file after shutdown of Canton had been initiated.

### Preview Features
- You might have noticed our new section on [error codes](https://www.canton.io/docs/0.24.0/user-manual/usermanual/error_codes.html#error-codes) on our website. We are currently working on providing exhaustive documentation on errors and their resolution. However, we are in the process of this cleanup and not all errors are yet in the newly documented form.

### Security and Bugfixes
- There is no security or bugfix worth mentioning in this release.
