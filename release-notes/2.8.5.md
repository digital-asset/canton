## Bugfixes

### (24-008, Major): Deadlock in Topology Dispatcher

#### Issue Description

When a topology change is sent to the sequencer and there is a problem with the transmission or sequencing, the topology dispatcher waits forever to receive back the corresponding topology transaction. Later topology changes queue behind this outstanding topology change until the node is restarted.

#### Affected Deployments

Participant, Domain and Domain Topology Manager nodes

#### Affected Versions

All 2.3-2.7 2.8.0-2.8.4

#### Impact

The node cannot issue topology changes anymore.

#### Symptom

Varies with the affected topology transaction: Party allocations time out, uploaded packages cannot be used in transactions (NO_DOMAIN_FOR_SUBMISSION), cryptographic keys can not be changed, etc.

The failure of sequencing can be seen in DEBUG logging on the node:
```
DEBUG c.d.c.t.StoreBasedDomainOutbox:... tid:1da8f7fff488dad2fc4c9c0177633a7e - Attempting to push .. topology transactions to Domain ...
DEBUG c.d.c.s.c.t.GrpcSequencerClientTransport:... tid:1da8f7fff488dad2fc4c9c0177633a7e - Sending request send-async-versioned/f77dd135-9c6a-4bd8-a6ed-a9a9f3ef43ca to sequencer.
DEBUG c.d.c.s.c.SendTracker:... tid:1da8f7fff488dad2fc4c9c0177633a7e - Sequencer send [f77dd135-9c6a-4bd8-a6ed-a9a9f3ef43ca] has timed out at ...
```
where the last log line by default comes 5 minutes after the first two.

#### Workaround

Restart the node.

#### Likeliness

Occurs for unstable network conditions between the node and the sequencer (e.g., frequent termination of a subset of the connections by firewalls) and when the sequencer silently drops submission requests.

#### Recommendation

Upgrade to 2.8.5
