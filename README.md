[Canton is a next-generation Daml ledger interoperability protocol](https://docs.daml.com/canton/about.html) that implements Daml's built-in models of authorization and
privacy faithfully.

* By partitioning the global state it solves both the privacy problems and the scaling bottlenecks of platforms such as
  Ethereum.

* It allows developers to balance auditability requirements with the right to forget, making it well-suited for building
  GDPR-compliant systems.

* Canton handles authentication and data transport through our so-called synchronization domains.

* Domains can be deployed at will to address scalability, operational or trust concerns.

* Domains can be implemented on top of various technologies, depending on the trust requirements.

* Domains are permissioned but can be federated at no interoperability cost, yielding a virtual global ledger that enables
  truly global workflow composition.
