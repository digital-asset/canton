Configure a KMS
===============

This section explains how to configure a Key Management System (KMS) in Canton.

Currently, three KMS alternatives are available:

- :ref:`AWS KMS <kms_aws_config>`\*
- :ref:`GCP KMS <kms_gcp_config>`\*
- :ref:`Driver(-based) KMS <kms_driver_config>` allows users to integrate their own KMS provider by implementing the necessary hooks using Canton’s KMS Driver API. Learn more about how to implement a Canton KMS Driver in the :ref:`Canton KMS Driver developer guide <kms_driver_guide>`.
