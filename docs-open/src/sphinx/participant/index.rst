This site describes how to operate a Participant Node, the component that connects
your applications to the Canton Network.

The table of contents contains links to tutorials for those getting
started with running a Participant Node, as well as how-tos, explanations, and
reference materials to assist experienced operators.

If you want to run Canton on a local, private deployment, then follow the instructions in this section.
