  * It has methods that enable the tracking and logging-upon-resolution of stateful degradation.
  *  Example scenario:
  *    - A participant is anomalously disconnect from domain -> we log an error and track that the error/degradation has occurred
  *    - The participant is reconnected to the domain -> we log a resolution message referring to the previous error and
  *    log that the degradation has been fixed
  * For an example use of this trait see CantonSyncService
  * @tparam E error type we are tracking
