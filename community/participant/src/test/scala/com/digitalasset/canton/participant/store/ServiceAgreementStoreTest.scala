                         |        limited to data pertaining to real world transactions or events,
                         |        persons, entities, or subjects, financial data, or Personal

                         |        ownership of the Your Data, subject to DA's ownership of the
                         |        Canton Service (including Daml libraries). You hereby grant DA
                         |        the right to use and access Your Data in connection with the
                         |        provision of any services, provided that DA does not (a)
                         |        disclose Your Data to a third party, except as compelled by law
                         |        in accordance with this Agreement, as expressly permitted in
                         |        writing by You, or as required for the provision of the Canton
                         |        Service; or (b) access, use, or modify Your Data, except as
                         |        required to provide the Canton Service, to prevent or address
                         |        service or technical problems, at Your request (_e.g._, in
                         |        connection with customer support matters), or as required for
                         |        the protection of DA's rights and interests. You shall be solely
                         |        responsible and liable with respect to Your Data.
                         |
                         |    5.  _PERSONAL INFORMATION OR SENSITIVE DATA_. Unless You enter into
                         |        a separate Data Processing Agreement with DA, and except as
                         |        provided in Section 10.2, You shall not disclose, enter, load,
                         |        use, or otherwise exploit any Personal Information or Sensitive
                         |        Data in connection with the Canton Service, including but not
                         |        limited to in connection with Your development or use of Your
                         |        Custom Applications, and shall not otherwise provide or furnish
                         |        any Personal Information or Sensitive Data to DA or any of its
                         |        employees, directors, officers, representatives, contractors, or
                         |        agents. DA does not intend uses of the Canton Service to create
                         |        obligations under the Health Insurance Portability and
                         |        Accountability Act of 1996 (as it may be amended from time to
                         |        time and its implementing regulations, "HIPAA"), and makes no
                         |        representations that any Service satisfies HIPAA requirements.
                         |        If You are (or become) a Covered Entity or Business Associate,
                         |        as defined in HIPAA, You will not use the Canton Service for any
                         |        purpose or in any manner involving Protected Health Information
                         |        (as defined in HIPAA) unless specifically permitted pursuant to
                         |        a separate Data Processing Agreement with DA. "PERSONAL
                         |        INFORMATION OR SENSITIVE DATA" means any information relating to
                         |        an identified or identifiable natural person, including any and
                         |        all similarly protected sensitive data; an identifiable natural
                         |        person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in
                         |        particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
                         |        identification number, location data, an online identifier or to
                         |        one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological,
                         |        genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that
                         |        natural person. The term Your Data does not include Personal
                         |        Information or Sensitive Data.
                         |
                         |    6.  _LOSS OF YOUR DATA_. In the event of any breach that compromises
                         |        the security, confidentiality, or integrity of Your Data, DA
                         |        shall notify You as soon as reasonably practicable after
                         |        becoming aware of such occurrence. If the breach compromises the
                         |        security, confidentiality, or integrity of Personal Information
                         |        or Sensitive Data, notwithstanding the fact that such data is
                         |        not permitted for use with the Canton Service, You are solely
                         |        responsible and shall be obligated to: (i) notify the affected
                         |        individuals as soon as practicable but no later than is required
                         |        to comply with applicable law, and (ii) perform or take any
                         |        other actions required to comply with applicable law as a result
                         |        of the occurrence. You agree that it is Your responsibility to
                         |        back up Your Data and any Custom Applications separately away
                         |        from the Canton Service. You agree that DA has no responsibility
                         |        to back up Your Data or any Custom Application and that DA bears
                         |        no liability for any loss of Your Data or any Custom
                         |        Application.
                         |
                         |        Notwithstanding the terms of any non-disclosure or confidentiality
                         |        agreement, if any, that may bind the Parties, the disclosure of Your
                         |        Data due to the act of a third party and the loss of Your Data are
                         |        addressed solely in this Section and are not covered by any other
                         |        non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement. In such event, DA's sole
                         |        responsibility is to act in accordance with this Section, and DA will
                         |        not be liable to You or any other party so long as it meets its
                         |        obligations in this Section.
                         |        
                         |    7.  _EXCESSIVE RESOURCE USE_. If DA determines in good faith that Your
                         |        resource usage (including, but not limited to, bandwidth, processing
                         |        cycles, storage, etc.) of the Canton Service is significantly
                         |        excessive in relation to DA's policies, DA reserves the right to
                         |        suspend Your use of the Canton Service or throttle Your access to
                         |        the Canton Service until You reduce such excessive resource
                         |        consumption.
                         |    
                         |    8.  _SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF THE SERVICE_. DA may suspend,
                         |        terminate, or restrict Your access to the Canton Service under any
                         |        of the following circumstances, and in such event DA will provide
                         |        You with reasonably prompt notice of the reasons for such suspension
                         |        or termination: (a) DA determines in good faith that You have
                         |        violated any of the restrictions set forth in this Agreement,
                         |        violated DA's Acceptable Use Policy available below that DA may
                         |        update from time to time (the "ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY"), or used the
                         |        Canton Service for any purpose other than the Purpose; or (b) DA
                         |        determines in good faith that such suspension is advisable (i) for
                         |        security reasons, (ii) in response to a request from law enforcement
                         |        or a governing body or in relation to legal proceedings, (iii) to
                         |        protect DA from liability, (iv) for the continued normal and
                         |        efficient operation of the Canton Service or to permit DA to
                         |        maintain or update the Canton Service. If You become aware that any
                         |        portion of Your Data or any activity violates this Agreement or any
                         |        applicable law, You shall immediately take all necessary action to
                         |        cease and prevent such activity and remove the portion of Your Data
                         |        violating this Agreement or applicable law from the Canton Service.
                         |        To the extent DA becomes aware that any part of Your Data, in DA's
                         |        reasonable discretion, is in violation of this Agreement or any
                         |        applicable law, DA may immediately delete or remove that part of
                         |        Your Data from the Canton Service or take any other action DA deems
                         |        appropriate. DA reserves the right to cooperate with any legal
                         |        authority and relevant third-party in the investigation of alleged
                         |        wrongdoing. Any violation of applicable law by You shall be Your
                         |        sole responsibility of, and DA shall have no liability towards You
                         |        for any consequences of such violation, including from the
                         |        suspension, termination of Your use of the Canton Service or from
                         |        the deletion of the Your Data.
                         |    
                         |    9.  _NO SLA OR TECHNICAL SUPPORT_. Alpha products, including the Canton
                         |        Service, may not always perform as specified and can be changed from
                         |        time to time without notice. With respect to this alpha program, You
                         |        acknowledge and agree that DA has no obligation to provide You with
                         |        any technical support services in relation to the Canton Service
                         |        under this Agreement, and that no Service Level Agreement ("SLA") or
                         |        any service credits apply to Your use of the Canton Service,
                         |        including with respect to any downtime. Support, if any, will be
                         |        governed by a separate agreement between DA and You.
                         |

                         |
                         |This Agreement is effective from the Effective Date until terminated in

                         |the other Party prior notice of the termination date. This Agreement

                         |successor agreement related to the Canton Service. The provisions
                         |relating to the following rights and obligations shall survive the

                         |Service. DA reserves the right to delete Your Data from the Canton
                         |Service within a reasonable amount of time after termination of this
                         |Agreement.

                         |10.  GENERAL
                         |
                         |    1.  _INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS_. DA and You will at all times be
                         |        independent contractors. Neither Party has any right, power or
                         |        authority to enter into any agreement for or on behalf of, or to
                         |        assume or incur any obligation or liabilities, express or
                         |        implied, on behalf of or in the name of, the other Party. This
                         |        Agreement will not be interpreted or construed to create an
                         |        association, joint venture or partnership between the Parties or
                         |        to impose any partnership obligation or liability upon either
                         |        Party.
                         |
                         |    2.  _YOUR INFORMATION_. Apart from account information, You shall
                         |        not disclose any Personal Information or Sensitive Data or
                         |        similarly protected or personal data to DA. If You disclose or
                         |        otherwise provide or furnish Personal Information or Sensitive
                         |        Data to DA, You represent and warrant that You have obtained all
                         |        the relevant consents to do so and will defend, indemnify and
                         |        hold DA harmless from and against any claims arising out of such
                         |        disclosure. To the full extent allowed by applicable law, You
                         |        agree that You are solely liable for all Personal Information
                         |        and Sensitive Data obligations, including, without limitation,
                         |        confidentiality and data protection and privacy obligations and
                         |        restrictions imposed by applicable law, regulation or court
                         |        order.
                         |
                         |        You agree to allow DA and its subsidiaries, Affiliates, subcontractors
                         |        and assignees to store, use, and transfer among such entities and
                         |        persons, any Personal Information or Sensitive Data provided by You,
                         |        including names, business phone numbers and business email addresses,
                         |        anywhere DA or any of such entities or persons does business worldwide,
                         |        provided that such information will be used only in connection with DA's
                         |        business relationship with You.
                         |
                         |    3.  _SEVERABILITY_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid
                         |        or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining
                         |        provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect. The
                         |        Parties agree to replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with
                         |        one that matches the original intent of the Parties.
                         |    
                         |    4.  _THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES_. For the avoidance of doubt, all rights
                         |        and benefits granted under this Agreement to You will be deemed
                         |        granted directly to You. Otherwise, no third party will be deemed to
                         |        be an intended or unintended third-party beneficiary of this
                         |        Agreement. DA is not responsible for any third-party claims against
                         |        You.
                         |    
                         |    5.  _FORCE MAJEURE_. With the exceptions of confidentiality,
                         |        restrictions on use, and payment obligations, a Party will be
                         |        excused from the performance of its obligations under this Agreement
                         |        to the extent that such performance is prevented by Force Majeure
                         |        and the non-performing Party promptly provides notice of the
                         |        prevention to the other Party referencing this Section. Such excuse
                         |        shall be continued so long as the condition constituting force
                         |        majeure continues and the non-performing Party takes reasonable
                         |        efforts to remove the condition. "FORCE MAJEURE" means conditions
                         |        beyond the control of the affected Party, including an act of any
                         |        God, war, civil commotion, terrorist act, labor strike, failure or
                         |        default of public utilities or common carriers, fire, earthquake,
                         |        storm or like catastrophe, or failure or loss of utilities,
                         |        communications or computer (software and hardware) services
                         |        (provided that such failure could not have been prevented by the
                         |        exercise of skill, diligence, and prudence on the behalf of the
                         |        affected Party that would be reasonably and ordinarily expected from
                         |        a skilled and experienced person or entity engaged in the same type
                         |        of undertaking under the same or similar circumstances.
                         |    
                         |    6.  _ENTIRE AGREEMENT, ASSIGNMENT_. This Agreement constitutes the
                         |        entire agreement of the Parties pertaining to the subject matter
                         |        hereof, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings
                         |        pertaining thereto, notwithstanding any oral representations or
                         |        statements to the contrary heretofore made. This Agreement may not
                         |        be assigned or transferred by You without the prior written consent
                         |        of DA.
                         |    
                         |    7.  _MODIFICATION; WAIVER; RIGHTS_. DA MAY AMEND OR RESTATE THIS
                         |        AGREEMENT AT ANY TIME UPON NOTICE TO YOU, WHICH NOTICE MAY BE GIVEN
                         |        ONLINE. BY CONTINUING TO ACCESS OR USE THE CANTON SERVICE, YOU AGREE
                         |        TO BE BOUND BY ANY SUCH AMENDMENTS MADE BY DA. No amendment of this
                         |        Agreement may be made by You unless in writing and signed by both
                         |        Parties. All rights and remedies provided for in this Agreement will
                         |        be cumulative and in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other
                         |        remedies available to either Party at law, in equity or otherwise.
