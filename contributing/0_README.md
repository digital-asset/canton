Contributing to Canton
======================

If you are contributing for the first time or need to set up your development environment,
read [1_setup.md](1_setup.md) for instructions on how to set up your machine.

Then, read through the following files, as they contain very important guidelines that every contributor needs to know:
 * [2_building-and-running.md](2_building-and-running.md)
 * [3_scala-coding-guidelines.md](3_scala-coding-guidelines.md)
 * [4_testing.md](4_testing.md)
 * [5_ci-usage.md](5_ci-usage.md)
 * [6_github.md](6_github.md)

Finally, read the introductory sections of every other file in [the current folder](.),
so you get an idea of the Canton development ecosystem.
You do not have to read all the details yet,
you can leave that to the moment when you actually need the information.
